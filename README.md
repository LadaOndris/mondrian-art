# Mondrian art
A simple C program that generates mondrian paintings.

**main.c** contains code that creates the mondrian image.  
**bitmap.c** contains my own implementation of creating .bmp images.  

Run `make` to build the project, and execute `./art` to generate images as a bitmap.

## Examples
The .bmp files are examplary files generated by this program.  
These images are too big to be displayed in readme.

![Mondrian art](mondrian_art2.bmp)
