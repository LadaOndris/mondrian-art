# mondrian-art
A simple c program which generates mondrian paintings.

main.c contains code that creates the mondrian image. 

bitmap.c contains my own implementation of creating .bmp images.

The .bmp files are examplary files generated by the program.

These images are too big to be displayed in readme.
